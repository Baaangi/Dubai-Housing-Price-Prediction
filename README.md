# House Price Prediction 🏠📈

This project predicts house prices using **Multivariate Linear Regression**

##  Overview
- Built a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features such as size, location, and number of rooms.
- Implemented in Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.

##  Dataset
- Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/baaangi/properties-data] 


##  Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training using Linear Regression
5. Evaluation using R² metrics  

##  Results
- Achieved an R² score of: `0.72`
